<h1>Software Automatic Mouth</h1>
<h2>What is SAM?</h2>
<p>
Sam is a very small Text-To-Speech (TTS) program written in Javascript,
that runs on most popular platforms. It is an adaption to Javascript of
the speech software SAM (Software Automatic Mouth) for the Commodore
C64 published in the year 1982 by Don't Ask Software
(now SoftVoice, Inc.). It includes a Text-To-Phoneme converter called
reciter and a Phoneme-To-Speech routine for the final output.
</p>
<p>
Currently compatible with Firefox, Chrome, Safari + iOS.
The conversion was done by hand from the C source code by
<a href="https://github.com/s-macke/SAM">Sebastian Macke</a>,
and the refactored versions by
<a href="https://github.com/vidarh/SAM">Vidar Hokstad</a> and
